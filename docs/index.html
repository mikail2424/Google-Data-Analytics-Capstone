<h4><em>This Case Study was completed as part of the Google Data
Analytics Professional Certificate.</em></h4>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________________</p>
</div>
<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<hr />
<p>You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team
at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago; whose bike-share program
has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked
into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked
from one station and returned to any other station in the system
anytime. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success
depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your
team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use
Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design
a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
But first, Cyclist executives must approve your recommendations, so they
must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.</p>
</div>
<div id="business-task" class="section level2">
<h2>Business Task</h2>
<hr />
<p>Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general
awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that
helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing
plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as
casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic
members. Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members
are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing
flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that
maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth.
Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new
customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual
riders into members. Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing
strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In
order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better
understand how annual members and casual riders differ. Moreno and her
team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data
to identify trends.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
</div>
<div id="objective-ask-phase" class="section level1">
<h1>1. Objective (Ask Phase)</h1>
<hr />
<p>The objective of this business task is to analyze how Cyclistic’s
annual members and casual riders differ in order to design marketing
strategies targeted at maximizing the share of annual members; with an
emphasis on converting current casual riders to annual members.</p>
</div>
<div id="prepare-phase" class="section level1">
<h1>2. Prepare Phase</h1>
<hr />
<p>In order to do my analysis I complied twelve consecutive months (July
2021- June 2022) of Cyclistic’s bike-share rider data. The data is
provided by Divvy Bike Company, and can be found at: <a
href="https://ride.divvybikes.com/system-data"
class="uri">https://ride.divvybikes.com/system-data</a> The data is
public and made available by Motivate International Inc. under this <a
href="https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement">license</a>.
Finally to protect the safety and privacy of the riders, riders’
personally identifiable information has been removed from the
dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="process-phase" class="section level1">
<h1>3. Process Phase</h1>
<hr />
<p>In order to prepare the data for analysis the year’s worth of
ride-share data was processed and cleaned using the SQL Script on MySQL.
To begin the ride-share data was imported into tables, with thirteen
original columns listed in the SQL script.</p>
<pre class="sql"><code>Create table july_21 (
   ride_id Text,
   rideable_type Text,
   time_trip_started Timestamp,   
   time_trip_ended Timestamp,
   bike_station_start Text,
   start_station_id Text,
   bike_station_end Text,
   end_station_id Text,
   start_lat Real,
   start_lng Real,  
   end_lat Real,
   end_lng Real,
   customer_type Text);</code></pre>
<p>After inspection, any anomalies or errors were removed and the
individual tables were combined into a single table, collating the
entire year’s worth of rider data. Next I identified the outliers for
trip duration for my data, and removed these observations from my data.
Then I identified bike station locations that were NULL, empty, test, or
a maintenance station to remove these trips from my data as well.</p>
<pre class="sql"><code>Select timestampdiff(minute, time_trip_started, time_trip_ended), time_trip_started, time_trip_ended, bike_station_start, bike_station_end 
 from full_year
 where (timestampdiff(minute, time_trip_started, time_trip_ended) &lt;= 3 
 and bike_station_start = bike_station_end)
 and not bike_station_start = &#39;&#39;
 or timestampdiff(minute, time_trip_started, time_trip_ended)  &lt;= 1
 order by timestampdiff(minute, time_trip_started, time_trip_ended);
 
delete from full_year
 where bike_station_start = &#39;351&#39;
 or bike_station_start = &#39;DIVVY CASSETTE REPAIR MOBILE STATION&#39;
 or bike_station_start = &#39;WEST CHI-WATSON&#39;
 or bike_station_start = &#39;Base - 2132 W Hubbard Warehouse&#39;
 or bike_station_start = &#39;Base - 2132 W Hubbard&#39;
 or bike_station_start = &#39;Pawel Bialowas - Test- PBSC charging station&#39;
 or start_station_id like &#39;%DIVVY%&#39;;</code></pre>
<p>Afterwards a new column for trip duration, month, time of day, and
year were created, and these new columns were added these to to my
dataset to bolster my later analysis.</p>
<pre class="sql"><code>ALTER TABLE full_year
 Add month Text;
 Update full_year
 set month = (date_format(time_trip_started, &#39;%M&#39;))</code></pre>
<p>With this done I created two new tables containing the location data
from the dataset by partitioning the dataset by start and end
destination. Afterwards I combined these two tables in one representing
all unique bike station locations and an count of the frequency of each
bike station usage.</p>
<pre class="sql"><code>locations1 as 
 Select bike_station_combine, count(bike_station_combine) as count, combine_lng, combine_lat  
 FROM locations
 group by bike_station_combine;</code></pre>
<p>Finally after a final inspection of the whole dataset, the cleaned
dataset was exported into a csv file for final analysis and
visualization. An complete and detailed explanation of the cleaning
process can be found in my SQL script <a href="Links.html">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="analyze-share-phase" class="section level1">
<h1>4 &amp; 5. Analyze &amp; Share Phase</h1>
<hr />
<p>My analysis and visualizations were done in the R statistical
programming language using RStudio. For the analysis I began by
importing the csv file exported by my SQL script into Rstudio. I
finished my analysis by visualizing Cyclistic’s bike station locations,
and then the most popular and least popular bike stations were complied,
and mapped as well.</p>
<p><u>The full analysis and visualizations can be found in my final
analysis <a href="Cyclistic.Analysis.html">here</a>.</u></p>
<p>Finally I derived three recommendations for Cyclistic marketing
analyst team from my analysis on the Cyclistic bike-share program, and
the three marketing recommendations for the marketing analyst team can
be found outlined below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong><em>A Digital Ad Campaign highlighting the Tourist
Attractions in Chicago’s Metro Hub and Coast</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The final analysis of Cyclistic’s bike stations locations displayed
that riders’ most popular bike stations were stationed near Chicago’s
metro hub and coast, validating prior knowledge that most riders use the
bike-share program for leisure. Moreover deeper analysis into causal
riders supported this analysis as well, as analysis showed that causal
riders preferred to ride on the weekend and after regular work hours
suggesting casual riders were riding for fun rather than for commuting
to work. Therefore, the Cyclistic marketing team should capitalized on
this by running an digital ad campaign targeted towards causal riders
that both highlights the major tourist attractions in metro Chicago and
scenic coastline, and promotes the use of Cyclistic’s bikes. Finally
this could be accomplished by combining promotional ads that display
Cyclistic’s customers enjoying their time on bikes at major metro
Chicago spots, and by creating a series of suggested tailored scenic
bike routes through metro Chicago that encourage riders to try the
different bike routes over a extended period of time. Thus, encouraging
casual riders to switch to the annual membership in order to save on the
multiple scenic bike rides.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong><em>A Digital Marketing Campaign highlighting a Discount on
Electric Bikes for Annual Members</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, while most riders use the bike-share program for
leisure, analysis showed that causal riders overtake annual members
during the late night hours of 10PM till 5AM, suggesting that these
later riders were using the bike for commuting and travel. Additionally,
across all time casual riders take bike trips that are significantly
longer than annual members, therefore I recommend a targeted marketing
campaign promoting a discount on electric bikes for annual members, that
would run digital ads at bike stations at night. Thus, casual riders
would be incentivize to convert to annual memberships to attain the
benefits of shorter trips times and no longer needing to cycling from
using electric bikes, which would be especially beneficial to this
section of casual riders traveling or commuting at night after a long
tiring day.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong><em>Offer Discounted Cyclistic Annual Memberships during the
Summer</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Finally the Cyclistic analyst marketing team should take advantage of
the significant increase in causal riders during the summer season by
offering an promotional discount that lowers the price of the annual
membership during the month of July, August, and September. Furthermore
as a result of Chicago’s clement weather during this time, Cyclistic can
also capitalize on the increase in ridership and good weather by
partnering the discount with ads highlighting serene bike rides in the
pleasant weather.</p>
